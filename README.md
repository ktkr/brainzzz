We drew inspiration from procrastination in the classroom.
Students are not always attentive and this could be for various reasons.
We wanted to find a way to measure each student's attention and see how they perform with respect to those readings.
Our app for viewing and recording real-time electroencephalogram data.
We built both apps using the Ionic framework and BackAnd for our backend.
The student app is connected directly to the headset and the student can view his/her own concentration level during the course of the lesson.
The teacher app is connected to the database and receives the concentration levels of all the students.
We used d3.js to plot graphs that help the teacher plan their lessons around low attention periods and also give them better feedback regarding a student's performance.
The headset acrylic piece changes colour according to the attention level of the student.
